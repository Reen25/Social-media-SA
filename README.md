Sentiment Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of social media posts, leveraging machine learning techniques to classify the sentiment of text data as positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis is a valuable tool for understanding public opinion, customer feedback, and social trends. By analyzing the sentiment of large volumes of text data, businesses and researchers can gain insights into how people feel about various topics, products, or services.

Project Objectives
Data Collection: Collect and preprocess a dataset of social media posts.
Feature Engineering: Transform the text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.
Model Training: Train a machine learning model to classify the sentiment of text data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using accuracy metrics.
Deployment: Deploy the model in a Streamlit application to provide real-time sentiment analysis of user-input text.
Project Structure
The project consists of the following main components:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Load and preprocess the dataset containing social media posts.
Clean the text data by removing noise, such as punctuation, URLs, and special characters.
Tokenize and stem the text data to standardize the words.
Remove stopwords to focus on meaningful words.
Feature Engineering:

Use TfidfVectorizer to transform the text data into numerical features.
Handle categorical features such as platform and country.
Model Training:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a logistic regression model to classify the sentiment of the text data.
Save the trained model and vectorizer using joblib for later use.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy metrics.
Analyze the distribution of sentiments and the relationship between various features and sentiments using visualizations.
Deployment:

Develop a Streamlit application to provide a user-friendly interface for sentiment analysis.
Load the trained model and vectorizer in the Streamlit app.
Allow users to input text and get real-time sentiment predictions.
Installation
To run the project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
colorama
plotly
nltk
tqdm
wordcloud
scikit-learn
joblib
streamlit
You can install the required packages using pip:

sh
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn colorama plotly nltk tqdm wordcloud scikit-learn joblib streamlit
Usage
1. Training and Saving the Model
Run the train_save_model.py script to train the model and save it along with the vectorizer:

sh
Copy code
python train_save_model.py
2. Loading and Using the Model
Run the load_use_model.py script to load the saved model and vectorizer, and use them for sentiment analysis:

sh
Copy code
python load_use_model.py
3. Streamlit Application
Run the app.py script to start the Streamlit application:

sh
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
In the Streamlit app, you can enter text for sentiment analysis, and the model will provide real-time predictions.

Data
The dataset used for this project consists of social media posts labeled with sentiment. The dataset includes features such as the text of the post, platform, country, and timestamp. The text data is cleaned and preprocessed to remove noise and standardize the text.

Model
The model used for sentiment analysis is a logistic regression classifier. The text data is vectorized using TfidfVectorizer, which converts the text into numerical features based on term frequency-inverse document frequency. The trained model is evaluated using accuracy metrics to ensure its performance.

Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations to analyze the distribution of sentiments and the relationship between different features and sentiments. Visualizations include:

Pie chart showing sentiment distribution.
Count plots showing the relationship between year, month, day of the week, platform, country, and sentiment.
Bar plot showing the most common words in the text data.
Conclusion
This sentiment analysis project provides a comprehensive approach to analyzing the sentiment of social media posts. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project demonstrates how to preprocess text data, train a model, and deploy it in a user-friendly application. The insights gained from sentiment analysis can be valuable for businesses and researchers to understand public opinion and trends.

Future Work
Expand Dataset: Incorporate more diverse and larger datasets to improve model performance.
Advanced Models: Experiment with advanced models such as neural networks for better accuracy.
Additional Features: Include more features such as user information and post metadata.
Real-time Data: Integrate real-time data collection from social media platforms for live sentiment analysis.
